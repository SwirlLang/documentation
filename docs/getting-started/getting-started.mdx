```

Then paste the following in the file or write your own

```sw title="test.sw"
print("Hello World!, I am learning Swirl")
```

now compile the file

```shell

```

It will make a binary called **test** in the current folder. Execute it using `./test`.

It should output `Hello World!, I am learning Swirl`.

Congrats you've made your first Swirl app.
