Swirl alpha announcement

<!--truncate-->
We are today releasing the first alpha version of swirl. Please keep in mind that this version is not ready to be used in production yet, it is only meant for testing purposes. We would really appreciate any feedback you may have so that we can work on further improving it. The current version of swirl includes a barebone compiler which can be easily extended depending on future needs.
